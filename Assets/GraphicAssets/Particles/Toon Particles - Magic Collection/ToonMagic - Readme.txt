This is a great starting point for video game special effects, resizing and coloring to a new project might be a little work.

• Uses materials; “Mobile Alpha Blended”,  ”Mobile Additive” for glow


SCALING TIPS

Start with scaling Speed, Size and Gravity to the aproximate percentage,
then adjust Shape, Velocity and Force until the particle system has the desired look.
Lastly adjust Renderer Lenght Scale if needed.

Icluded in this package is a script calles EasyScale, this automaticly scales Speed, 
Size and Gravity based on a multiplier.
